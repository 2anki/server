    'Convert a Markdown file into an Anki deck. Top-level bullets become card fronts, nested bullets become the answers, and the first heading names the deck.',

    },
    {
      q: 'Can I write the cards as Q/A pairs instead of bullets?',
      a: "Yes — write them as 'Q: question' followed by 'A: answer' on the next line and we'll detect the pattern. Mix and match with bullet-style cards in the same file.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Does it handle code blocks and LaTeX?',
      a: 'Triple-backtick code blocks come across as plain text inside the card — the content is preserved, the monospace styling is not. LaTeX inside $...$ and $$...$$ renders if you have MathJax enabled in Anki — turn it on in card template settings.',

      q: 'What if my file has thousands of bullets?',
      a: "We'll convert all of them. Big files take longer — usually under a minute for 1 000 cards. The free upload limit is 100MB; over that, split the file or upload a zip of smaller files.",
