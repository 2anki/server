      a: "Yes. Toggles become front/back cards. Strikethrough text in the page body becomes a tag on every card in that deck. If a block type isn't handled the way you'd like, send the page to support@2anki.net and we'll take a look.",

      q: 'Do I need a Notion integration token?',

      q: 'What happens to images and code blocks?',
