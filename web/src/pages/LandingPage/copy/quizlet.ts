      q: 'Do my starred or learned cards come across?',
      a: "The card content does. Quizlet's study state — starred, mastered, in-progress — isn't in the export, so it doesn't transfer. Anki will start each card fresh, which most learners prefer anyway.",

      q: 'What about image-only cards?',
      a: "Image cards work if the export includes image URLs. Quizlet's plain-text export is text-only, so images are skipped. If you have Quizlet Plus, the richer export keeps them.",

      q: "Is this allowed under Quizlet's terms?",
      a: "You're moving your own study material between apps you own accounts on. We don't scrape Quizlet — we only read the file you upload. If you don't have an export, we can't help.",
