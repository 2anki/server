title: Upload a file instead
description: For PDFs, slides, spreadsheets, or a Notion HTML export.
---

Upload works without an account. You drop in a file, 2anki builds the deck, and you download an `.apkg`. Good for one-off conversions or sources that don't live in Notion.

**Plan:** Free (anonymous, no sign-in needed)

## When to use upload instead of Connect Notion

Upload when:

- The source is a PDF, slide deck, spreadsheet, CSV, or Markdown file.
- You don't have a Notion workspace, or the page isn't in Notion.
- You want a fast one-shot conversion and don't need future edits to flow into the deck.

Use [Connect Notion](/documentation/start-here/connect-notion) when the source is a Notion page and you want the deck to update as you edit.

## Drop in a file

1. Go to [2anki.net/upload](https://2anki.net/upload).
2. Drag your file onto the drop area, or click to pick one.
3. Open the settings panel if you want to change card options. Defaults are tuned for first-time use — see [Card options](/documentation/cards/card-options) for what each one does.
4. Click **Convert**. When it finishes, click **Download** to grab the `.apkg`.
5. Open the file in Anki — see [Open your deck in Anki](/documentation/start-here/open-in-anki).

:::tip
Toggle lists make the cleanest cards. If your source is plain prose, the conversion will still work, but you'll get better results from a structure where each card is one toggle, one bullet pair, or one row.

## Supported types

The full table of formats and limits is on [File formats](/documentation/reference/file-formats). Short version:

- **Notion HTML export** (`.zip`) — the `.zip` Notion gives you when you export with "HTML" + "Include subpages".
- **HTML** — a single `.html` file or a folder of them.
- **Markdown** — `.md`, including Obsidian vaults.
- **CSV / XLSX** — one row per card.
- **PDF** — front/back per page pair, or AI-generated questions on paid.
- **PPT / PPTX** — converted via slides to PDF to images.

Drop the wrong format and 2anki tells you. The error message names the supported types so you don't have to guess.

## What happens to your file

We need the file long enough to convert it. After that:

- **Anonymous and Free account file uploads** — the temporary working files are wiped within two hours. The `.apkg` is sent straight back as the response, so we don't keep a copy.
- **Claude AI uploads and Notion conversions** are stored in your account so you can re-download from **My uploads**. Free accounts: removed within 24 hours. Subscription: kept while your sub is active. Lifetime: kept indefinitely.
- We don't read your content for any reason other than building your deck. We don't train models on it.

The full story is on the [privacy policy](/documentation/reference/privacy). The hard numbers are on [Limits and quotas](/documentation/help/limits).
