title: Open your deck in Anki
description: Get the .apkg you downloaded into Anki on any device.
---

Anki opens `.apkg` files on every platform — desktop, iPhone, iPad, Android, and the web. The flow is slightly different on each. Pick yours below.

**Plan:** Free (Anki itself is free on every platform except iOS)

## Anki desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

1. Make sure Anki is installed — [download it from ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Double-click the `.apkg` file you downloaded. Anki opens and imports it.
3. The new deck appears in your deck list, ready to study.

If double-click doesn't work, open Anki and use **File → Import**, then pick the `.apkg`.

## AnkiMobile (iPhone, iPad)

AnkiMobile is a paid app from the official Anki team — buying it directly funds Anki's development.

1. Save the `.apkg` to the Files app (e.g. via AirDrop, Mail, or iCloud Drive).
2. Open Files, tap the `.apkg`, and pick **Open in AnkiMobile**.
3. Confirm the import. The deck appears in your deck list.

If the file opens in a preview app instead, use the **Share** button and pick AnkiMobile from the list.

## AnkiDroid (Android)

AnkiDroid is free on Google Play.

1. Save the `.apkg` to your phone — direct download from Chrome or Firefox works.
2. Open the file from your notifications or the Files app.
3. Pick **AnkiDroid** when Android asks how to open it. The deck imports automatically.

## AnkiWeb

AnkiWeb is the official sync service. You can study in the browser, but it's mainly used to keep desktop and mobile in sync.

1. Sign in at [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/).
2. AnkiWeb itself doesn't import `.apkg` files directly — import on desktop or mobile, then let Anki sync the deck up to AnkiWeb.

## Updating an existing deck

If you re-convert the same Notion page or file, 2anki keeps the card IDs stable. Re-importing the new `.apkg` updates existing cards in place — your review history stays intact, you don't get duplicates.

:::warning
This relies on the **Use Notion ID** card option (on by default for Notion sources). If you turned it off, re-importing creates new cards alongside the old ones. See [Card options](/documentation/cards/card-options).
:::

For Notion pages where you want updates to flow automatically without re-uploading, use [Sync](/documentation/sync/how-it-works) instead.
