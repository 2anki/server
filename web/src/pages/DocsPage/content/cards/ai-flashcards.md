title: AI flashcard generation
description: When 2anki should write the cards for you — Claude for any PDF, Vertex AI for question generation.
---

Two card options send your source to an AI model instead of running the normal toggle/bullet parser. Use them when your source isn't already shaped like flashcards — long-form PDFs, lecture transcripts, dense study material — and you want the model to pull the question-answer pairs out for you.

**Plan:** Subscription or Lifetime. Free accounts see the toggles but the conversion falls back to the standard parser.

## When to use this

- Your source is a PDF that's all prose — a textbook chapter, an article, lecture notes — and there are no toggles or bullets to convert.
- You've tried the standard parser and it produced too few cards, or none.
- You have a specific angle you want the cards to take ("focus on dates and names", "use clinical vignettes", "skip the introduction").

If your source is already structured — Notion toggles, Obsidian bullets, a spreadsheet with question and answer columns — the standard parser will be faster and more accurate. Skip AI for those.

## Generate Flashcards with Claude AI

The general-purpose option. Sends your content to Anthropic's Claude and uses the response as your deck.

1. On the upload screen, open the settings panel.
2. Switch **Generate Flashcards with Claude AI** on.
3. (Optional) Open **User instructions** and write a sentence or two about the kind of cards you want.
4. Upload your file. The job runs in the background — you can leave the page and come back to **My uploads** to download.

The result is a normal `.apkg`. You can re-download it from **My uploads** for as long as your plan keeps it (see [Limits and quotas](/documentation/help/limits) for storage windows).

### Writing good user instructions

The model does better with a clear angle than with a long brief. One or two sentences is plenty.

Useful instructions:

- "Focus on USMLE Step 1 high-yield. Skip background paragraphs."
- "Make every card a clinical vignette ending in a question."
- "Use the exact wording from the source on the back."

Skip instructions like "make great flashcards" or "explain everything" — the model already tries to do that.

## Generate Questions from Single PDF File Uploads (Vertex AI)

A narrower option, scoped to single PDFs. Sends the PDF to Google Vertex AI to generate question-and-answer pairs page by page.

1. Open the settings panel before uploading.
2. Switch **Generate Questions from Single PDF File Uploads** on.
3. Upload a single PDF. ZIPs and Markdown don't use this path.

Use this when you want question generation tuned to a specific page-by-page rhythm, or when Claude's output for a particular textbook looks off. The output runs through the same packaging step, so the resulting `.apkg` opens in Anki just like any other.

## Storage and privacy

AI conversions take longer than the standard parser — the deck builds in the background and is stored in your account so you can re-download it. Plan windows:

| Plan | How long the AI deck is kept |
|---|---|
| Free | Falls back to standard parser (no AI) |
| Subscription | Kept while your subscription is active |
| Lifetime | Kept indefinitely |

We send the content to the model only to build your deck. We don't train on it. Full details on the [privacy policy](/documentation/reference/privacy).

## Common mistakes

- **Empty PDF.** If the model can't find anything to turn into a card, the conversion fails with *Claude couldn't find any content to turn into flashcards in this Notion page* (the same message fires for PDFs). Check that the PDF has selectable text — scanned images won't work without OCR first.
- **Conflicting options.** Turning on both **Generate Flashcards with Claude AI** and the standard toggle options doesn't double the cards. Claude takes over for the whole document.
- **Cost expectation.** Each AI conversion uses model credits on our end. We don't pass per-card pricing through, but very large PDFs may take several minutes to finish.
