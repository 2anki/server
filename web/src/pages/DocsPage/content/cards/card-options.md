description: Every checkbox on the upload screen, what it does, and when to turn it on.
---

Card options change how 2anki turns your source into flashcards. Most are off-or-on toggles. Defaults are tuned so a fresh upload "just works" — touch them when you want a different shape of deck.

## How to set options

- **On the upload screen** — click the settings icon next to the upload area to see every option for that conversion.
- **In account settings** — `Settings → Card options` saves defaults that apply to every new upload. You can still override per upload.
- **Per Notion page** — when you convert through the Notion integration, options are saved against the page so the next sync uses the same shape.

## Deck shape

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Deck name | — | Custom name for the downloaded `.apkg`. Leave empty to use the source's name. |
| Font size | 20 | Base font size for card text, in pixels. |
| Toggle mode | Close nested toggles | Controls whether nested toggles render open or closed on the card back. |
| Page emoji | Icon first | Where the page emoji shows up in the deck title — first, last, or disabled. |
| Basic note type | `n2a-basic` | The Anki note type name 2anki uses for basic cards. Change it to plug your own template in. |
| Cloze note type | `n2a-cloze` | Same, for cloze cards. |
| Input note type | `n2a-input` | Same, for typed-input cards. |

## Card content

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Use All Toggle Lists | On | Picks up toggle lists nested anywhere in the page. Off means only top-level toggles are used. |
| Use Plain Text for Back | Off | Strips formatting from the back of cards so only the text content remains. |
| Maximum One Toggle Per Card | On | Splits nested toggles into separate cards instead of stacking them in one. |
| Preserve Newlines in the Toggle Header and Body | On | Keeps SHIFT-Enter line breaks inside toggles instead of collapsing them. |
| Markdown Nested Bullet Points | On | Reads Markdown bullet hierarchies (Obsidian-style) as front/back pairs. |
| Disable Indented Bullets | Off | Stops indented bullets from each becoming their own card. |

## Card types

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Cloze Deletion | On | Creates cloze cards from inline `code` snippets. |
| Treat Bold Text as Input | Off | Bold text is removed and turned into a typed-answer field. Good for fact recall. |
| Basic and Reversed | Off | Creates the front/back card and a reversed copy. |
| Just the Reversed Flashcards | Off | Only creates the reversed card. Useful when the back is more useful as a prompt (e.g. an image). |

## Filtering

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Cherry Picking Using 🍒 Emoji | Off | Only creates cards from toggles that contain a 🍒 emoji. Useful for picking out a few cards from a long page. |
| Only Create Flashcards From Toggles That Don't Have The 🥑 Emoji | Off | Skips toggles that contain a 🥑 emoji. Useful for marking parts of a page as not-yet-ready. |
| Treat Strikethrough as Tags | Off | Treats strikethrough text as Anki tags. Strikethrough inside a toggle becomes a tag local to that card; outside, it's a global tag. |

## Links and formatting

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Add Notion Link | Off | Adds a link to the Notion page where the toggle was created. Use this with **Use Notion ID** to avoid duplicates. |
| Use Notion ID | On | Uses Notion's ID to match cards across re-uploads instead of regenerating IDs from the field text. Reduces duplicates. |
| Remove Underlines | Off | Drops underline formatting. Helps when Notion underlines clash with Anki's link styling. |
| Remove the MP3 Links Created From Audio Files | On | Strips the auto-generated `.mp3` links left behind by some Notion exports. |

## PDF and AI

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Process PDF Files | On | Converts PDFs found in ZIP uploads. Turn off to skip PDFs and speed up large archives. |
| Generate Questions from Single PDF File Uploads | Off | Sends the PDF to Google Vertex AI to generate questions. Paid; sends content to Google Cloud. |
| Generate Flashcards with Claude AI | Off | Sends content to Anthropic Claude and uses its output as the deck. Paid. |
| User instructions | — | Free-form prompt sent to Claude when **Generate Flashcards with Claude AI** is on. Example: *"Focus on USMLE high-yield. Skip the introduction."* |
| Convert Image Quiz HTML to Anki Cards | Off | Uses OCR to pull image-and-answer pairs from HTML quizzes. Premium experimental. |

## Multiple choice

These only fire when **Enable MCQ** is on. See [Multiple choice questions](/documentation/cards/mcq) for the full guide.

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Enable MCQ | Off | Detects multiple-choice toggles and produces interactive MCQ cards instead of basic ones. |
| Show choices | Show up front | Whether the options appear on the front of the card, or behind a button you click to reveal. |
| Shuffle options | On | Randomize the option order on every review so position can't be a hint. |
| TTS for the question | Don't speak | Read the question aloud. Languages: English (US), Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin (Simplified), Portuguese (Brazil). |
| TTS for the correct answer | Don't speak | Read the correct answer aloud. Same language list. |
| TTS for extra | Don't speak | Read the explanation aloud. Same language list. |

## Debugging

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Share Files for Debugging When Conversion Fails | Off | If a conversion fails, sends the file and error details to the 2anki team. Off by default to keep your notes private. |
