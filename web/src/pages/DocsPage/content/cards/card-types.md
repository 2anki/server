description: The four card shapes 2anki makes, and when each fires.
---

2anki produces four card shapes. Which one you get depends on what's in your source — bold text becomes a typed answer, code becomes a cloze, a checked option in a toggle becomes an MCQ, and everything else stays as a basic front/back card.

**Plan:** Free (all three card types work on every plan)

## Basic

The default. The toggle's heading becomes the front; the toggle's contents become the back.

In Notion:

- A toggle with the heading "What is the capital of Albania?" and "Tirana!" inside.

In Markdown (with **Markdown Nested Bullet Points** on):

```
- What is the capital of France?
  - Paris
```

In HTML:

```html
<details>
  <summary>What is the capital of Albania?</summary>
  <p>Tirana</p>
</details>
```

You also get **Basic and Reversed** as a card option — that creates the front/back card and a second card with front and back swapped. Useful for vocabulary. See [Card options](/documentation/cards/card-options).

## Cloze

Cloze hides part of a sentence. You see "The capital of France is [...]" and type or recall "Paris".

2anki turns inline code into clozes. Wrap the hidden text in backticks (Markdown) or `<code>` tags (HTML):

```
- The capital of `France` is `Paris`
```

```html
<details>
  <summary>The capital of <code>Albania</code> is <code>Tirana</code></summary>
</details>
```

You can also use Anki's native cloze syntax directly when you want explicit numbering or hints:

```
{{c1::Canberra::city}} was founded in {{c2::1913::year}}
```

The **Cloze Deletion** card option controls whether code-as-cloze fires — it's on by default. See [HTML](/documentation/cards/html) and [Markdown and Obsidian](/documentation/cards/markdown) for more examples.

## Input

Input cards make you type the answer. You see the question, type, and Anki marks it right or wrong by exact match.

Turn on **Treat Bold Text as Input** in card options. Then bold text on the back becomes the typed-answer field:

```
- What is 21 + 21 = **42**
```

```html
<details>
  <summary>What is 21 + 21?</summary>
  <p><strong>42</strong></p>
</details>
```

Best for facts where exact spelling matters — dates, names, equation results. Skip it for definitions or anything where wording can vary.

## Multiple choice

MCQ cards show a vignette plus 2–7 options; on the back, the correct option highlights green and the explanation reveals.

Author one by making a Notion toggle whose title is the question. Inside the toggle, add a to-do block per option (`/to-do`) and check exactly one — or add a bulleted list and bold exactly one option's full text. The checked or bolded option is the correct answer.

In Notion's markdown shortcuts:

```markdown
> Which antibiotic class inhibits cell wall synthesis?
    - [ ]  Fluoroquinolones
    - [x]  Beta-lactams
    - [ ]  Macrolides
    - [ ]  Aminoglycosides
```

The full guide with step-by-step worked examples lives on [Multiple choice questions](/documentation/cards/mcq).

MCQ detection runs automatically on Notion HTML exports — no card option to toggle. Toggles that don't match the MCQ shape fall through to Basic, Cloze, or Input as usual.

## How to switch between them

You don't pick a card type per card. You pick a card option, and 2anki applies it across the whole upload:

- **Basic** is the default whenever a toggle has nothing else going on.
- **Cloze** fires automatically when **Cloze Deletion** is on (default) and your toggle contains code.
- **Input** fires when **Treat Bold Text as Input** is on and your toggle has bold text on the back.
- **Multiple choice** fires when a Notion toggle's children are to-do blocks with one checked, or bulleted items with one fully bolded.

If a single toggle has both code and bold text, cloze wins. If you want a different mix, split the toggle in your source.

The full card option list with defaults is on [Card options](/documentation/cards/card-options). The card templates Anki uses (`n2a-basic`, `n2a-cloze`, `n2a-input`, `n2a-mcq`) are listed in the [glossary](/documentation/reference/glossary).
