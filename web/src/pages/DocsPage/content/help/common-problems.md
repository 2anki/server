If you saw an error and want the fix, find the heading below that matches what you saw. If your problem isn't here, [contact us](/documentation/help/contact) or [report a bug](/documentation/help/bug-report).

## "Please select a file to upload."

**What you saw.** A red error appears the moment you submit, before anything uploads.

**Why it happened.** The form was sent without a file attached.

**How to fix it.** Drag a file onto the upload area or click it to pick one from your computer. See [supported formats](/documentation/reference/file-formats).

## "The uploaded file appears to be invalid. Please try again."

**What you saw.** The upload starts but fails immediately.

**Why it happened.** The browser sent a file with no name. This usually happens when an extension or background process intercepts the upload.

**How to fix it.** Try a different browser, or disable extensions that touch downloads or uploads (privacy tools, "save-to-cloud" extensions). Then re-attach the file.

## "[file] appears to be empty. Please re-export your file and try again."

**What you saw.** The upload returns this message with the name of your file.

**Why it happened.** The file is 0 bytes — usually because an export failed silently or the file copied while the source app was still writing.

**How to fix it.** Re-export from the source (Notion, Obsidian, Excel, etc.). Confirm the file has content by opening it locally before uploading.

## "[file] is already an Anki deck. 2anki converts source files like Notion HTML exports, not existing decks."

**What you saw.** You tried to upload an `.apkg`.

**Why it happened.** 2anki creates Anki decks; it doesn't read them. Uploading an existing `.apkg` isn't a flow we support.

**How to fix it.** Upload the source you used to make the deck (HTML export, Markdown, PDF, CSV) — not the deck itself. To open an `.apkg` you already have, see [Open your deck in Anki](/documentation/start-here/open-in-anki).

## "PDF exceeds maximum page limit of 100 for free and anonymous users."

**What you saw.** A PDF upload fails right after you submit it.

**Why it happened.** Free accounts cap PDFs at 100 pages so the conversion stays fast and free.

**How to fix it.** Split the PDF into smaller files (every PDF reader has a "split" option), or [subscribe](/pricing) to remove the cap. See [Limits and quotas](/documentation/help/limits) for the full list.

## "Could not create a deck using your file and rules."

**What you saw.** The upload finishes but produces no deck.

**Why it happened.** 2anki couldn't find anything that looks like a flashcard. By default it looks for toggle blocks; without toggles, you'll need to enable a different option.

**How to fix it.** Open [Card options](/documentation/cards/card-options) and turn on the option that matches your source — for Markdown bullet hierarchies, **Markdown Nested Bullet Points**; for Notion exports without toggles, restructure your source, or [contact us](/documentation/help/contact) with an example.

## "Claude couldn't find any content to turn into flashcards in this Notion page."

**What you saw.** You enabled Claude AI generation and the conversion failed with this message.

**Why it happened.** The page Claude received was empty or only contained layout elements (buttons, placeholders) — nothing it could turn into a question.

**How to fix it.** Add headings with explanations, toggle lists, or question-and-answer text to the page, then convert again.

## A Notion page won't show up in the picker

**What you saw.** You connected Notion but a page you want to convert isn't listed.

**Why it happened.** Notion only shares pages you've explicitly given the 2anki integration access to.

**How to fix it.** Open the page in Notion → **Share** → **Add connections** → pick **2anki**. Then refresh the picker.

## Some images are missing from my deck

**What you saw.** Cards show up but pictures are broken.

**Why it happened.** You probably uploaded a single `.html` file instead of the full `.zip`. Notion's HTML export references images in an `assets/` folder, and uploading just the `.html` leaves the images behind.

**How to fix it.** Upload the original `.zip` instead. If your browser auto-extracts zips, turn that off — in Safari, **Preferences → General**, uncheck **Open "safe" files after downloading**.
