description: What's allowed on each plan, and how long your decks stick around.

2anki.net is free for the conversion features. The limits below keep the hosted service fast for everyone. If you self-host, you can change them — see [self-hosting](/documentation/reference/self-hosting).

## File size

| Plan | Max upload size |
|---|---|
| Free | 100 MB per request |
| Subscription / Lifetime | ~10 GB per request |

Free covers anonymous and signed-in users without a paid plan. The file-size limit lives in `src/lib/misc/getUploadLimits.ts`.

## PDF pages

| Plan | Max pages per PDF |
|---|---|
| Free | 100 |
| Subscription / Lifetime | No fixed cap |

PDFs over the free limit return: *PDF exceeds maximum page limit of 100 for free and anonymous users.*

## AI-generated flashcards

The **Use Claude AI** card option is a Subscription / Lifetime feature. Free accounts see the toggle but the conversion falls back to the standard parser.

## Chat

The Chat study assistant is available to all signed-in users.

| | Free | Subscription | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| Messages per month | 20 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Message length | 4 000 characters | 100 000 characters | 100 000 characters |
| Model | Claude Haiku | Claude Sonnet | Claude Sonnet |

Free users who reach 20 messages see the exact reset date (first of the following month). Message count resets monthly.

## Storage

What "storage" means depends on which path you used.

### File upload (no Claude AI)

Your file lives on disk only long enough to build the deck. The `.apkg` is sent straight back as the response — we don't keep a copy. The temporary working files are wiped after **two hours**.

**Plan:** any (anonymous, Free account, Subscription, Lifetime — same window for all).

### Notion convert and Claude AI uploads

These paths build your deck in the background and store the `.apkg` in our bucket so you can re-download it from **My uploads** and so [sync](/documentation/sync/how-it-works) has something to update.

| Plan | How long your decks stay in the bucket |
|---|---|
| Free account | Removed in the next daily cleanup (within 24 hours). |
| Subscription | Kept for as long as your subscription is active. |
| Lifetime (Patreon) | Kept indefinitely. |

If your subscription lapses, your stored decks are removed in the next daily cleanup — re-convert and they come back. You can also delete a deck yourself from **My uploads** at any time.

## Free vs paid

Free covers the conversion paths most people need: drag in a file, get a deck back. The paid plans add AI-generated flashcards, larger uploads, longer storage, and Notion sync.
