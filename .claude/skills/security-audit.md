Audit the requested surface against the rule table in `.claude/rules/security.md`. Read-only — no edits, no installs, no network requests beyond `gh`/`git`.

Scope:

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a path or glob, audit those files.
- Otherwise, audit `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only` filtered to `*.ts` / `*.tsx` under `src/` and `web/src/`.

For each file, walk the security rule table. For every match, report:

```
<path>:<line>  [CWE-xxx]  <one-line finding>
  evidence:    <code snippet>
  suggested:   <concrete fix in one sentence>
```

Pay particular attention to these stack-specific risks:

1. **SSRF on outbound HTTP** (CWE-918) — any `axios.get/post/...` that isn't `instrumentedAxios` is a finding. Check `services/observability/FEATURE.md` for the wrapper contract.
2. **SQL via knex.raw** (CWE-89) — flag any `knex.raw(\`...${x}\`)`; bindings are required.
3. **Falsy-ID rejection** (CWE-754) — `!id`, `!user`, `if (value)` for "is the ID present?" checks; should be `value == null`.
4. **Secrets in logs** (CWE-532) — `console.log` / `console.error` with `password`, `token`, `cookie`, `secret`, or full request bodies.
5. **Path traversal** (CWE-22) — multer-uploaded `originalname` reaching `path.join` / `fs.writeFile` without `getSafeFilename`. Zip extraction without `..` checks.
6. **Webhook signature** (CWE-345) — Stripe/Notion webhook handlers that parse JSON before verifying HMAC, or skip verification.
7. **Auth in controllers** (CWE-862) — auth checks that should live in `routes/middleware/`.
8. **Hardcoded secrets** (CWE-798) — anything matching the patterns in `.claude/hooks/pre-write-secret-scan.py`.

End with a summary: count of findings by CWE, and the top three to fix first. Do not propose code changes — surface, don't patch. The user invokes `/implement` afterwards if a fix is wanted.
