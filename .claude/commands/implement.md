description: Take a spec and ship it - take over the draft spec PR, code, tests, mark ready
argument-hint: spec PR number or URL (preferred), or paste the spec / path to a spec file

Use the `engineer` agent.

## Primary path — take over the draft spec PR

When `$ARGUMENTS` is a PR number or URL (or you can find a draft PR titled `spec: …` for the spec at hand), graduate that PR to implementation rather than creating a new branch:

1. Fetch the PR (`gh pr view <n> --json title,headRefName,isDraft,body`) and check out its branch locally:
   ```
   gh pr checkout <n>
   ```
   The branch should already be `feat/spec-<slug>` / `fix/spec-<slug>` / `refactor/spec-<slug>` etc. (the spec author picked the prefix to match the implementation). If it is still on the legacy `docs/spec-<slug>` shape, rename the local branch and update the PR head before pushing more commits:
   ```
   git branch -m feat/spec-<slug>
   git push origin -u feat/spec-<slug>
   gh pr edit <n> --head feat/spec-<slug>
   ```
2. Read the spec at `Documentation/specs/<slug>.md` (it is the source of truth — do not re-derive scope).
3. Follow the engineer workflow in `.claude/agents/engineer.md`:
   - Restate the change in one sentence.
   - Trace the code path (list files, name the layer).
   - Plan the diff.
   - Write the failing test first (TDD per CLAUDE.md).
   - Implement (smallest viable change, no comments — meaningful names instead).
4. Commit in logical chunks on the existing branch using conventional-commit messages.
5. Before the final push, remove the spec file — its text lives in the original `docs: add spec for …` commit on this branch and in the deletion diff:
   ```
   git rm Documentation/specs/<slug>.md
   git commit -m "chore: remove implemented spec for <feature name>" \
     -m "Spec text preserved in git history: git log -p -- Documentation/specs/<slug>.md"
   ```
6. Run `/check` (parallel tsc + web typecheck + web vitest + web lint). All green before flipping the PR.
7. Graduate the PR from draft to ready, and rename the title to match the implementation prefix:
   ```
   gh pr edit <n> --title "<type>: <feature name>"   # feat: / fix: / refactor: / ...
   gh pr ready <n>
   ```
   Update the PR body to the engineer template in `.claude/agents/engineer.md` (What / Why / How / Measuring success / Testing / Risks / Goal alignment). Keep the link to the trio synthesis if it was useful.

Before merging:
- All checks green.
- If user-facing, ping the `designer` agent for a review pass.
- If the change touches auth, payments, or external-API integration, run `/security-review` first.
- Note goal alignment in the PR body (per `CLAUDE.md`).

## Fallback — no draft spec PR exists

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a raw spec (pasted body or a path to a `.md` file with no associated draft PR):

1. Read the spec.
2. Follow the engineer workflow above.
3. Suggest a branch name. Format: `<type>/<short-slug>` using a conventional commit prefix (`fix/`, `feat/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `test/`). Do **not** use `docs/` for an implementation branch.
4. Once confirmed, create the branch, commit in logical chunks, run `/check`, then open the PR (not draft) with `gh pr create` using the engineer template.

In this path there is no spec file in the repo to remove — skip the spec-cleanup commit.
