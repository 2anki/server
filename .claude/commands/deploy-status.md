description: SSH to 2anki.net, show pm2 status and recent server log tail
allowed-tools: Bash
---

Run a single SSH call:

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 alemayhu@2anki.net "pm2 list && echo '---LOGS---' && pm2 logs server --lines 80 --nostream 2>&1 | tail -100"
```

Then report concisely:

- **Process**: online / errored / restarted recently? Note recent uptime, not the lifetime ↺ counter.
- **Recent activity**: are real requests being served (200/304 in access logs)?
- **Errors**: distinguish user-facing thrown errors (e.g. `getNoPackageError`) from actual crashes (`uncaught exception`, native binding failures, EADDRINUSE).
- **Verdict**: one paragraph — "deploy healthy" / "watching X" / "broken, escalate".

Don't dump the full log. Surface specifics only when something is wrong.
